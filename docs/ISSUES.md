## 🟠 High Priority

### ISS-006: VEO RAI Safety Filter Rejections
**Status**: Open (Partially Mitigated)  
**Reported**: 17 December 2025  
**Updated**: 17 December 2025  
**Symptoms**: Video generation fails with content moderation errors  
**Root Cause**: VEO's RAI filters reject prompts containing people-related terms even when `personGeneration: "dont_allow"` is set. The filter scans the prompt text itself, not just the generated content.  
**Workaround**: 
- Implemented `sanitisePromptForVideo()` to remove terms like "traveller", "customer", "family"
- Added critical requirements to prompts: "NO people, NO faces, NO human figures"
- Using backup API key (VEO_API_KEY_2) when primary fails  
**Success Rate**: ~40% of prompts now succeed (up from ~10%)  
**Planned Fix**: 
1. Pre-filter prompts through Gemini to rewrite people-focused prompts into scenic equivalents
2. Fallback to animated image (GIF) when video fails
3. User notification with option to retry with different prompt

**Status**: Open  
**Reported**: 17 December 2025  
**Symptoms**: Video generation state lost on page refresh

**Planned Fix**: Serialise video operation names to localStorage

### ISS-008: Brand Profile Edit Not Reflected
**Status**: Open  
**Reported**: 17 December 2025  
**Symptoms**: Editing brand profile in side panel doesn't regenerate content  
**Expected**: New content should use updated profile  
**Planned Fix**: Add "regenerate with new profile" button

---

## 🟢 Low Priority

### ISS-010: Missing Export Functionality
**Status**: Open  
**Reported**: 17 December 2025  
**Symptoms**: No way to download generated content
